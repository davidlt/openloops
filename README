OpenLoops is a Fortran 90 package for the calculation of tree and one-loop
matrix elements for Standard Model processes based on

============
Installation
============

Requirements

    gfortran 4.6 or later, or ifort
    Python 2.x starting with 2.4
    Apache Subversion (optional, to install from SVN)

You can either download OpenLoops from SVN (recommended)

    svn checkout http://openloops.hepforge.org/svn/OpenLoops/branches/public OpenLoops

or from the OpenLoops web page

    http://www.hepforge.org/downloads

Compile

    cd OpenLoops
    ./scons

Download and compile process libraries

    ./scons auto=<processes>

where <processes> is a comma separated list of the processes or
process collections (ending with "/") which should be installed.
A list of the available process libraries can be found here

    http://openloops.hepforge.org/processes

The set of available processes will be extended continuously.
If you need a process which is not (yet) available, please contact the
OpenLoops authors.


================================================================
Update OpenLoops from SVN (when it's already installed from SVN)
================================================================

To pull updates from SVN and compile

    svn update
    ./scons

To update process libraries (will install new libraries if available and
replace old libraries if newer versions are available)

    ./scons auto=lhc/

After updating OpenLoops, updating the installed processes might be required
for compatibility.

Support and citations
=====================

Please help us improving OpenLoops by sending feedback to

    openloops@projects.hepforge.org

If you use OpenLoops (or an event sample generated with Sherpa+OpenLoops)
please cite

In the computation of loop amplitudes, OpenLoops uses CutTools for OPP reduction
and OneLOop to compute scalar integrals (unless other reduction libraries are
installed and used). If you use CutTools and OneLOop please cite

================
Sherpa+OpenLoops
================

OpenLoops can be used as a plug-in of Sherpa 2.1.0 or later. For the
installation of Sherpa and the usage of Sherpa+OpenLoops please refer to the
Sherpa documentation at

    https://sherpa.hepforge.org

OpenLoops must be enabled by configuring Sherpa with the '--enable-openloops'
option

    ./configure --enable-openloops=</path/to/OpenLoops> [other configure options]
    make
    make install

The OpenLoops installation path can be modified at runtime by setting
(in the Sherpa run card or command line)

    OL_PREFIX=</path/to/OpenLoops>

To run Sherpa in combination with OpenLoops it is sufficient to set the flag

    Loop_Generator=OpenLoops

in the Sherpa runcard. Standard Sherpa+OpenLoops run cards can be found at

    http://openloops.hepforge.org/sherpa-runcards
